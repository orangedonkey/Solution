# Solution 

This project is a Java conversion of a C# coding example.
[Click here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1083348/Csharp-BAD-PRACTICES-Learn-how-to-make-a-good-code)
to see the original C# example.

## Details

This project uses Maven, a common build and software management tool. It also makes use of TravisCI, an online continuous integration tool and Codecov, an code coverage tool. This project includes examples of:
  - Unit Tests (including a mocking framework, Mockito)
  - Logging using SLF4J and Logback
  - building a .jar using Maven and running the resulting software from Powershell (Windows) and Bash (Linux)
  - good coding practices as seen in the original C# example

## What could you do next
  - convert this project to Java 1.9 (the latest version of Java), or any other language
  - convert this Maven project to a Gradle project (Gradle is an alternative build tool to Maven)
  - automate the deployment and running of this appication (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku)
  - deploy this application within a container (Docker)
